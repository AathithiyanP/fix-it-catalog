## Setup Instruction
### Clone Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to download the project files:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AathithiyanP/fix-it-catalog.git
```

### Install Dependencies using npm
This project uses npm to manage packages for both the frontend and backend

#### For the Backend 
``` shell
cd backend
npm install
```
#### For the Frontend
``` shell
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Run Backend & Frontend Seperatively
To see the platform in action, you need to start the backend server and the frontend development environment separately.

#### Start the Backend (API Server)
``` shell
# From the /backend directory
npm start
```
#### Start the Frontend (Web Interface)
``` shell
# From the /frontend directory
npm run dev
```
